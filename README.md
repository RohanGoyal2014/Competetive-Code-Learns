# Competetive-Code-Learns
This repo includes the code that I must remember at all times when I encounter a problem
<ol>
<li>Large Array can be declared globally</li>
  <li>Bitsets may be highly useful in reducing complexities<br><u>Example:</u>https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/graph-representation/practice-problems/algorithm/utkarsh-in-gardens-february-easy/description/</li>
  <li><b>Custom Lowerbound Function</b>:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12968498/compare-function-in-lower-bound</li>
<li>Important DPs:
  <ul><li>https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/dynamic-programming/introduction-to-dynamic-programming-1/practice-problems/algorithm/number-of-rs-1/<br><strong>How to detect the application of Maximum Subarray Problem:</strong>For a range from 1 to n, at some point i we check ans=max(maxSubArraySum(1...i),maxSubArraySum(i+1...n),maxSumPassingThroughi) which is seen in divide and conquer equivalent of Maximum Subarray Problem</li><br><br>
    <li><b>Partion such that two subsets have minimum difference:</b> https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/dynamic-programming/introduction-to-dynamic-programming-1/practice-problems/algorithm/amazing-test/</li>

    <li><b>Important 3d dp: </b>https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/dynamic-programming/2-dimensional/practice-problems/algorithm/shift-the-array-4074fac2/description/<br>Approrach the question using 26^n and then see how to memoize</li>
