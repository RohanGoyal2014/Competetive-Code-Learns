# Competetive-Code-Learns
This repo includes the code that I must remember at all times when I encounter a problem
<ol>
  <li>Large Array can be declared globally</li>
  <li>
    Copy by reference + Global Declarations reduces running time
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid <b>endl</b>, it increases runnning time
   </li>
  <li>Bitsets may be highly useful in reducing complexities
    <br>
